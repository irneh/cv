# CV/resume - Henri Gabriel

<henri@workforpizza.com>

## Converters

General form: `pandoc henri.md -o henri.<file-format>`.

### PDF

Add `-V fontfamily=sans`.

### Word

The preferred mechanism is to generate a `reference.docx` with Pandoc. Then
edit it. Then refer to it during the conversion. But since I don't have Word I
can't see what a Word user will truly see. Will leave the defaults and not
attempt to style the output.
