Well, OK. So the review. Cozy, familial. At 11:30AM on a Sat only two other couples. Downside they knew each other and the owner guy (?) by name. Fake intimacy. They all greeted us like it was a club. Not down with that. I didn't try to make friends. Small space. But I'd do it the same. Food made to order. I didn't use words to order. Just used two fingers to point at the two things we wanted. Oh, food? Far from bad. I felt like it was that - we could make this at home but don't want to today. On the other hand the (vegan) tacos had some grilled stuff that we wouldn't have done at home. And an asparagus sandwich? Hadn't thought of that. So my inner heart is like a 3.5 but public facing would be a 5. Because can't complain about the crowd which was two 30-somethings... It was, like, ... I thought I was hearing a text-to-speech of Instagram where they're competing to show how good and successful their lives are. We agreed we'll go back. Low friction. See the guy. Tell him what you want. Cooks it right there. Gives it to you and you're out. Inner 3.5, outer 5. More places like this.
